## **Project Overview**
This project aims to:
- Clean and preprocess raw sales data with missing values.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand sales trends.
- Train a regression model to predict future sales.
- Visualize insights and predictions in Power BI.

---

## **Dataset Description**
The dataset used in this project contains information about:
- **Date**: The date of the transaction.
- **Region**: The region where the sales occurred.
- **Product**: The product sold.
- **Sales**: The revenue generated (some values are missing).
- **Units Sold**: The number of units sold (some values are missing).

### Sample Data
| Date       | Region | Product   | Sales | Units Sold |
|------------|--------|-----------|-------|------------|
| 2024-01-01 | North  | Product A | 500   | 25         |
| 2024-01-01 | North  | Product B | NaN   | 15         |
| 2024-01-01 | South  | Product A | 700   | NaN        |

## **Project Workflow**
1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handled missing values using mean and median imputation.
   - Converted dates to proper datetime format and extracted day, month, and year.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyzed sales trends, product performance, and regional contributions.
   - Visualized missing value patterns and sales trends.
3. **Predictive Modeling:**
   - Used Linear Regression to predict future sales based on historical data.
   - Evaluated the model using RMSE.
4. **Power BI Dashboards:**
   - Visualized sales trends, product performance, and predictions interactively.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Data Analysis: `pandas`, `numpy`
  - Visualization: `matplotlib`
  - Machine Learning: `scikit-learn`
- **Visualization Tool**: Power BI

## **How to Run**

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Install required libraries using:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
  ```

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Retail-Sales-Analysis-and-Prediction.git
   cd Retail-Sales-Analysis-and-Prediction
   ```
2. Place the raw dataset (`Enhanced_Sales_Data.csv`) in the project directory.
3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python analysis_and_prediction.py
   ```
4. Export the processed data and predictions as CSV files.
5. Import the CSV files into Power BI for visualization.

## **Power BI Visualization**
The Power BI dashboards include:
1. Sales trends over time.
2. Regional performance.
3. Product-wise performance.
4. Predicted future sales.
